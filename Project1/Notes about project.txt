can give file that is too big to write to memory
can have word longer than wrap length
	-> if this happens word is printed on new line(longer than wrap length) this is unavoidable
use low level IO functions

File I/O lectures started on 2/17


Error conditions:
	- if file DNE/cannot be opened use perror to report a message to the user and end with EXIT_FAILURE
	- if input has a word that is longer than the page width, print it on a single line by itself
		-> continue printing rest of file and exit with EXIT_FAILURE


PART 2:
	- when the 2nd argument is a directory ww will reformat each file in the directory
		and write the output to a NEW file with the prefix "wrap"
		./ww 80 foo --> makes any file in that directory wrap.fileName
	- Ignore any files whose names begin with a period or the string "wrap"
	- Use stat and macros S_ISDIR and S_ISREG to determine whether 2nd arg is file or directory
			-> use stat or d_type field to distinguish files and subdirectories
