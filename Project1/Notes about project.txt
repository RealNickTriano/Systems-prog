can give file that is too big to write to memory
can have word longer than wrap length
	-> if this happens word is printed on new line(longer than wrap length) this is unavoidable
use low level IO functions

File I/O lectures started on 2/17

List of issues:
	- If statements detecting spacing are not working
		-> isspace works on its own and I can do stuff based on if theres a space or not,
			but when using && operator it seems to never work	
			isspace can only say if its not a space?
			ISSPACE RETURNS NONEZERO IF ITS A SPACE AND ZERO IF NOT THE LECTURE WAS A LIE.
